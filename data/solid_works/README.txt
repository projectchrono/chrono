NOTE

Files in this directory have been generated with the
Chrono::Engine add-in for SolidWorks. The add-in can be 
downloaded from the www.chronoengine.info web site. 
Here you can see some examples of systems that have been
exported from SolidWorks: you can import them in
Chrono::Engine using a procedure explained, for instance,
in demo_import_solidworks.cpp. 

You do not need SolidWorks for using these files, they
have been already converted for you.

Note that the SolidWorks add-in outputs .py files that
contain the description of the mechanical system (masses,
constraints, etc.) and directories with the .obj meshes 
for the visualization if needed. If needed you may
also edit the .py file or create one from scratch, as
well as you can edit the .obj shapes with Blender or
other 3D software.
