# Schema for a Chrono::TDPF YAML fluid solver specification file.
# The `chrono-version` must match the Chrono major and minor version numbers.
# TDPF simulations do not need to specify any integrator or solver settings
# as they only represent applied forces on FSI bodies (and therefore use the
# MBS solver).
