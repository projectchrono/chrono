CHRONO::ENGINE
==============

Chrono::Engine is a part of [Project Chrono](http://www.projectchrono.org). It is a library for physical simulation of complex mechanisms with parts, constraints, contacts and collisions.

Main features
-------------

* cross-platform C++ API
* fast and efficient multi-body dynamics 
* wide set of constraints between parts
* motors and forces can be added to the mechanism
* collision shapes and frictional contact
* time integration based on non-smooth dynamics (DVI)
* real-time visualization or ray-tracing postprocessing
* modularity: optional units can be built for special purposes (postprocessing, cosimulation, FEM, etc.)
* wrapper for Python scripting
* demo code explaining how to develop third party applications

How to install and build the library
------------------------------------

You can find instructions about the installation and the build toolchain at the [Wiki](http://www.projectchrono.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)

  
How to develop your application based on Chrono::Engine
