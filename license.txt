1) FREE LICENSE
Binaries from the Chrono::Engine middleware can be freely used and

also, the Developer can distribute his client software as long as he
states that he used Chrono::Engine in his documentation.

The client software can be either open-source or closed-source.


2) OPEN SOURCE LICENSE
If the Developer wants to access the source of Chrono::Engine
for customizing/expanding/changing it, the Developer can ask
a full access to the source code, via SVN, according to these

If the Developer requires the source code access for developing
commercial applications that generate some revenues, a license fee must 
be agreed with the licensor in order to get access to the SVN.

2.2) - ACCESS FOR RESEARCHERS
In this case, access to the source code via SVN is free, but only 
if the Developer uses Chrono::Engine for non-business purposes

Developer can actively contribute to the development of the code 
by joining the developer team.
