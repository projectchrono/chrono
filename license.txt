1) ROYALTY-FREE LICENSE
The Chrono::Engine middleware is FREE for non-business 
software developement, that is hobby, academic researches and 
non-profit researches. In these cases, the Developer is free to use 
and modify Chrono::Engine components and source code; also, 
the Developer can distribute his client software as long as he
states that he used Chrono::Engine in his documentation.
Client software based on this license of Chrono::Engine can be 
freely distributed, but only if it is freeware and is meant to be 
used at home or in non-profit organizations.
The client software can be either open-source or closed-source.
The Chrono::Engine code, headers and documentations must be
distributed all together - not separately.


2) BUSINESS LICENSE
For business/commercial uses (ex: developement of non-freeware
software, or use in non-academic researches) a license fee
must be paid to DeltaEngineering, depending on the two 
following sub-cases:

2.1) - BUSINESS LICENSE FOR DEVELOPING IN-HOUSE SOFTWARE
In this case the Developer uses Chrono::Engine to make custom 
client software, provided that the user of the application
will be the developer himself (for a maximum of 5 copies
running simultaneously in the developer's offices) OR
a single third-party customer (for a maximum of 2 copies 
running simultaneously in the customer's offices).

2.2) - OEM BUSINESS LICENSE FOR COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE
In this case the Developer uses Chrono::Engine to make custom
applications to be put on the market and to be sold to 
third-party customers, as for videogames, simulators, 
CAD tools, etc.
A fee must be paid to DeltaKnowledge, based on the number
of copies of client applications and/or on a fixed fee, negotiable
between the Developer and DeltaKnowledge.

Under special case-by-case agreements between the parties the 
source code of the middleware can be released to the Developer, 
with an additional fee and only for licenses of the 2.1) or 2.2) type,
but in this case the source code must be kept confidential and should 
not be distributed outside the offices of the Developer.
