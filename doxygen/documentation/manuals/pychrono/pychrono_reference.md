PyChrono technology reference {#pychrono_reference}
==========================

PyChrono is a Python wrapper for Chrono. It is a set of
Python modules that correspond to units of Chrono, as
shown in this scheme:

Differences between Python and C++
----------------------------------

Not all the functionalities of the C++ API can be mapped 1:1 to the
Python API, of course. Python is an interpreted language that differs
from C++ for many reasons, so there are some differences and
limitations, but also advantages. If you already used the C++ API of
Chrono, you will find that this documentation is useful for
easily jumping into the PyChrono development.

### Object creation

In C++ you can create objects in two ways: on the stack and on the heap
(the latter is used for *dynamic allocation*). For example,
respectively, this is **object creation in C++ language**

~~~~{.cpp}
chrono::ChSystem  my_system;  // on stack, or..
chrono::ChSystem* my_system_pointer = new chrono::ChSystem();  // on heap 
~~~~

In the second case, in C++ you must remember to deallocate the object
with *delete (my\_system\_pointer)* soon or later. In Python, object
creation is always done in a single way: *objectname =
namespace.classname()* , and it does not require that you remember to
delete an object, because the lifetime of an object is automatically
managed by Python. So **object creation in Python** is simply:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
my_vect = chrono.ChSystem()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the = operator in Python does not mean *copy* (except for
simple types such as integers, floats, etc.) but means *assign*, so for
example

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
my_systemA = chrono.ChSystem()
my_systemB = my_systemA      # assign another handle to the same system
my_systemA.SetTol(2)
print (my_systemB.GetTol())
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will output 2, because you created a single ChSystem object, with two
handles pointing to it.

### Templated classes

Currently there is no support for templated clases in Python. So, all the C++ classes relying on templates need to be wrapped in Python in order to provide the most relevant specializations. Since the most fundamental templated classes offer aliases for the most common specialization those names are reflected also in the Python wrapper.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
chrono.ChVector3d         # as ChVector3d  in C++
chrono.ChQuaterniond      # as ChQuaterniond  in C++
chrono.ChMatrix33d        # as ChMatrix33d  in C++
chrono.ChMatrixDynamicd   # as ChMatrixDynamic<double>  in C++
chrono.ChFramed           # as ChFramed  in C++
chrono.ChFrameMovingd     # as ChFrameMoving<double>  in C++
chrono.ChCoordsysd        # as ChCoordsysd  in C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a (quite limited) support for templates of templates, especially
for the std::vector<> container. The concept is the same: the C++ template 
is translated in a special name in Python. For std::vector, we prepend
the vector_ prefix: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
chrono.vector_ChVector3d   # as std::vector<ChVector<double>>  in C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


### ChVector x y z members

In C++ you access the x y z components of a 3D vector using the 
functions ```x() y() z()```, that return a reference to the components. 
To avoid some issues, we drop the () parentheses and we 
mapped these functions to direct access to ```x y z``` class 
members in Python, so:

~~~~{.cpp}
chrono::ChVector<double>  my_vector;
my_vector.x() = 123;
double sum = my_vector.y() + my_vector.z();
~~~~

becomes

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
chrono.ChVector3d  my_vector
my_vector.x = 123
sum = my_vector.y + my_vector.z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A similar concept is applied for quaternions components e0 e1 e2 e3, 
eg. one uses myquaternion.e0 in Python, instead of myquaternion.e0() in C++.



### Shared pointers

Except for vectors, matrices, etc., most of the complex objects that you
create with the Chrono API are managed via C++ shared pointers.
This is the case of ChBody parts, ChLink constraints, etc. Shared
pointers are a C++ technology that allows the user to create objects and
do not worry about deletion, because deletion is managed automatically.
In the Chrono C++ API such shared pointers are based on
templates; as we said previously templates are not supported in Python,
but this is not an issue, because PyChrono **automatically handle objects with shared pointers if necessary**
PyChrono.

This is an example of **shared pointers in C++** :

~~~~cpp
std::shared_ptr<ChLinkLockRevolute>  my_link_BC(new ChLinkLockRevolute);
~~~~

This is the equivalent syntax **in Python** :

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
my_link_BC = chrono.ChLinkLockRevolute()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<div class="ce-info">
When you create a shared pointer object in PyChrono, also 
the referenced object is created. For instance, in the last example, 
a revolute joint is created at the same line. 
If you need other shared pointers to the same object, simply type 
```my_link_other = my_link_BC``` etc. 
</div>


Downcasting and upcasting
-------------------------

#### Upcasting

Upcasting of derived classes to the base class works **automatically**
in Python and does not require intervention. We managed to do this also
for shared pointers. For example *ChSystem.Add()* requires a
(shared)pointer to a *ChPhysicsItem* object, that is a base class, but
you can pass it a *ChBody*, a *ChLinkLockGear*, etc. that are derived
classes. The same in Python.

#### Downcasting

A bigger problem is the downcasting of base classes to derived classes.
That is, if a function *returns* a pointer to a base class, how to
understand that a specific returned object belongs to a derived class?
At the time of writing, an automatic downcasting is performed only for
classes inherited from ChFunction and ChAsset. Otherwise, one has to
perform manual downcasting using the `CastToXXX()` helper functions;
this is a bit similar to the ```dynamic_cast<derived>(base)``` method in C++.
Currently such casting functions are provided for many shared
pointers. Use this in Python as in the following example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
mybody = chrono.CastToChBody(ptr_to_contactable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Nested classes

SWIG does not currently support nested clases in Python (see http://www.swig.org/Doc4.0/SWIGPlus.html#SWIGPlus_nested_classes). Nested classes can be either ignored or, such as in PyChrono, flattened. This is automatically done for every nested class in Chrono.
This means that PyChrono equivalents of nested C++ classes will be in the upper namespace level, as you may see in the followig example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cpp
// class inheriting ReportContactCallback in C++
class ContactReporter : public ChContactContainer::ReportContactCallback { ... etc ...
//enum classes:
vehicle.SetChassisVisualizationType(chrono::vehicle::VisualizationType::MESH);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python we have:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~py
# class inheriting ReportContactCallback in Python
class ContactReporter(chrono.ReportContactCallback): ...etc...
#the same princliple applies to enum classes:
vehicle.SetChassisVisualizationType(pychrono.vehicle.VisualizationType_MESH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Not supported classes

We managed to map in Python most of the C++ classes of common interest,
but maybe that there are still some classes or functions that are not
yet mapped to Python. This can be understood in the following way.
Functions that are correctly mapped will return objects whose type is
echoed in the interpreter window as:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
my_system.GetGravitationalAcceleration()
<pychrono.ChVector3d; 
proxy of <Swig Object of type 'chrono::ChVector< double > *' at 0x03EDCEA8> >
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A function that is not yet mapped, for instance
ChSystem.GetSystemDescriptor(), will give a shorter echo, that
represents the type information for a pointer to an object that is
unusable in Python:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.py}
my_system.GetSystemDescriptor()
<Swig Object of type 'chrono::ChSystemDescriptor *' at 0x03EDD800>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<div class="ce-info">
As the development of PyChrono proceeds, the latter case will
happen less and less frequently. Tell us if you encounter this type of
problem in some function, so we can fix it.
</div>
