Visualization {#vehicle_visualization}
======================================

\tableofcontents

Chrono::Vehicle provides visualization support both for run-time interactive simulations, as well as for high-quality post-processing rendering for generating animations.  Currently, run-time simulation support expands on the underlying [Chrono::Irrlicht](@ref irrlicht_module) module for sequential simulations or the more computationally efficient but more limited [Chrono::OpenGL](@ref opengl_module) module for parallel simulations involving large-scale granular terrain representations.  Support for ray-traced renderings of individual simulation frames is offered through utility functions that can be called from within the simulation loop to export data files with current visualization assets information and a POV-Ray script that can batch-process these files to generate frame images.

## VSG-based run-time visualization {#vehicle_visualization_vsg}

The vehicle VSG-based run-time visualization uses a customized plugin to the base Chrono::VSG run-time visualization system to provide vehicle-specific capabilities, such as:
- vehicle-centric camera ("chase cam")
- display of vehicle-specific information
- control over visibility of individual vehicle subsystems
- etc.

The following images are snapshots from Chrono::Vehicle simulations.

## Irrlicht-based run-time visualization {#vehicle_visualization_irrlicht}

The vehicle Irrlicht-based run-time visualization uses the customized Irrlicht applications [ChWheeledVehicleIrrApp](@ref chrono::vehicle::ChWheeledVehicleVisualSystemIrrlicht) and [ChTrackedVehicleIrrApp](@ref chrono::vehicle::ChTrackedVehicleVisualSystemIrrlicht) for wheeled and tracked vehicles, respectively.

These are extensions of the base [ChIrrApp](@ref chrono::irrlicht::ChVisualSystemIrrlicht) application to allow:
- using a vehicle-centric camera location (point of view)
- displaying additional (vehicle-specific) statistics, such as vehicle speed, current driver inputs, powertrain torques, wheel and sprocket torques, etc.
- rendering of specified contact forces (tracked vehicles)

## Off-line rendering with POV-Ray {#vehicle_visualization_povray}

Off-line rendering requires the following steps:

- collect system data at each frame to be rendered
- optionally, prepare mesh data files in a format specific to the desired rendering engine
- post-process data files to render the scene at each frame
- optionally, combine multiple frame images into an animation

Chrono::Vehicle provides limited support for this workflow model and the [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) ray-tracing program.

**Preparing output data files**

- At each simulation frame that needs to be post-processed, call the function [WriteVisualizationAssets](@ref chrono::utils::WriteVisualizationAssets). 
- This function will output a comma separated value (CSV) file with a user-provided name containing.
- The output file contains information on all bodies in the Chrono system (positions and orientations), all associated visualization assets (position, orientation, type, and asset-specific parameters), and selected types of joints.  Note that mesh visualization assets are identified through their respective mesh name.

**Preparing mesh data files**

For rendering with POV-Ray, the Wavefront OBJ file corresponding to a mesh visualization asset must be converted to a macro in a POV-Ray input file.  This can be done by

- using the function [WriteMeshPovray](@ref chrono::utils::WriteMeshPovray)
- using a specialized tool such as [PoseRay](https://sites.google.com/view/poseray)

If using the rendering script described below, these mesh macro POV-Ray input files are expected to have a name identical to the corresponding mesh name. Furthermore, such a mesh POV-Ray input file must define a single macro (with the same name as the mesh name); as such, files generated by PoseRay need to be manually edited (see the examples provided with the Chrono distribution, for example `data/vehicle/hmmwv/POV-Ray/hmmwv_chassis.inp`).

**Post-process files with POV-Ray**

The Chrono distribution includes (in the directory `src/demos/vehicle/`) a sample POV-Ray script (`renderZ.pov`) which can be used for (batch) processing of output data files in the format generated by WriteVisualizationAssets.  This script assumes that all data is provided in a right-handed frame with Z up (ISO reference frame) and performs all required transformations to POV-Ray's Y-up left-handed frames.

This script provides the following user controls:
- render a single frame or a sequence of frames (batch processing)
- turn on/off rendering of body reference frames
- turn on/off rendering of the global reference frame
- turn on/off rendering of assets
- turn on/off rendering of assets fixed to ground
- turn on/off rendering of supported joints
- turn on/off rendering of springs and dampers
- specify dimensions of geometric shapes representing joints
- camera location and look-at point
- enable/disable shadows
- optionally render environment (ground and sky)

Note that the `renderZ.pov` script is provided only as a starting point. More complex and photo-realistic images can be generated with POV-Ray, using more sophisticated materials and environments.

Finally, a similar workflow can be used to render with different engines, other than POV-Ray.  For example, the image below was generated, using a data file generated by WriteVisualizationAssets but using the Mitsuba engine.
