Install the VEHICLE module   {#module_vehicle_installation}
===============================

[TOC]

Chrono::Vehicle is a module that enables template-based ground vehicle modeling and simulation within Chrono.

## Features

The **VEHICLE module** allows users to model and simulate vehicles. 

For more detail, read the [Chrono::Vehicle](@ref manual_vehicle) section of the reference manual.

## Dependencies

- This module has no additional dependenies
- Use the [CRGTerrain](@ref vehicle_terrain_crg) feature requires the [OpenCRG](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opencrg/) library. 

For run-time visualization, it is recommended to enable and install the [Chrono::VSG](@ref module_vsg_installation) module and/or the [Chrono::Irrlicht](@ref module_irrlicht_installation) module. 

## Building and installing prerequisistes

Chrono::Vehicle includes the option of specifying a terrain using an OpenCRG specification. Support for this optional capability requires the OpenCRG library.

The simplest way to build and install the OpenCRG library is to use the utility scripts provided with the Chrono distribution. 
These scripts (`buildOpenCRG.bat` and `buildOpenCRG.sh`, for Windows and Linux, respectively) are available in the `contrib/build-scripts/opencrg` directory of the [Chrono repository](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono/tree/main/contrib/build-scripts/opencrg). 

1. Copy the appropriate script and place in an arbitrary temporary directory.
2. Edit the script following the instructions in the top comments within the script.
3. Run the script (`.\buildOpenCRG.bat` or `sh buildOpenCRG.sh`, as appropriate) from the location of the script copy. This will create a temporary directory where all source repositories will be cloned and a set of directories where the individual URDF dependencies are built.
4. The install directory will contain the necessary header and library files required to configure Chrono::Vehicle with OpenCRG support.

## Building instructions
   
1. Repeat the instructions for the [full installation](@ref tutorial_install_chrono).
   
2. Set `CH_ENABLE_MODULE_VEHICLE` to 'on'.
	 
3. Press 'Configure' again, then 'Generate', and proceed as usual in the installation instructions.

If enabling OpenCRG support (`CH_ENABLE_OPENCRG`), you will be prompted to provide the location of a local installation of OpenCRG, including the location of the headers, library, and (Windows only) the location of the OpenCRG DLL.


## How to use it
