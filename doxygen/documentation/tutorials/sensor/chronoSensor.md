Chrono SENSOR module tutorials {#tutorial_table_of_content_chrono_sensor}
===============================

The Chrono distribution contains several demos for modeling and simulating sensors for robots and autonomous vehicles with the [SENSOR module](@ref sensor).

Chrono::Sensor provides support for:
 - RGB mono Camera 
 - Lidar
 - Radar
 - GPS
 - IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
 - Tachometer  

These are parameterized models of sensors commonly used in robotic and autonomous vehicle systems.

In addition to the main library, the SENSOR module also creates a library of pre-defined [SENSOR models](@ref sensor_overview) which currently contains:

- Generic Camera
- Lidar
  - Generic lidar
  - Velodyne VLP-16 (Puck)
  - Velodyne HDL-32E
- Generic GPS
- Generic IMUs
