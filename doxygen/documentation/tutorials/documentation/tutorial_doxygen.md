[Doxygen Manual](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/)


##Installing doxygen

### Windows:
The recommended way to install doxygen is by using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). Start by following the installation instructions for choclatey and then run

~~~
choco install doxygen.install -y
~~~

###Linux
Install ```doxygen``` through your favorite package manager

###OSX
Install doxygen using homebrew

~~~
brew install doxygen
~~~


##Building documentation

The documentation is in the main chrono repository in the ```doxygen``` folder. To build the documentation run the ```doxygen``` command in this directory. By default, the documentation will be built in ```/tmp/chrono_doxygen```.  To change the output directory, edit the file ```Doxyfile``` and change the variable ```OUTPUT_DIRECTORY```.

The instructions below also mention the corresponding syntax in the old MediaWiki-based Chrono documentation.

###Links

A mediawiki link ```[http://www.povray.org POVray]``` becomes ```[POVray](http://www.povray.org)``` in markdown

###Referencing a page in doxygen

If the page starts with

~~~
About Chrono::Solidworks
==========================
~~~

In the header you can reference it with the ```@ref``` command

~~~
[Chrono::SolidWorks](@ref manual_chrono_solidworks)
~~~

###Headings 
In mediawiki ```===``` specified headings, in markdown ```###``` specifies a heading, the more pound symbols there are the lower the heading level. <br>
Example: ```=== Create a column ===``` becomes ```### Create a column```


### Images
Images must be in the documentation/images/ folder to be picked up by doxygen, if you would like to add more folders modify the ```IMAGE_PATH             = documentation/images/``` setting in ```Doxyfile```.

Images can be added as follows:

###Converting Details Blocks

The text in the wiki:
~~~
{{Details|content=
We suggest to install also the following third party packages for expanding the capabilities of Python in mathematical ad plotting areas:
* [http://numpy.scipy.org/ Numpy]
* [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ Matplotlib].

NOTE. Precompiled binaries of Numpy and Matplotlib for Python 3.2 can be downloaded  from the unofficial [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ repository]. A faster option is to install the entire [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy-stack SciPy stack] that includes both.
Otherwise there is a custom Python distribution called [http://enthought.com/products/epd.php Enthough] that already includes the two packages.

Here is another example:
~~~
{{Details|content=
The files for this demo can be found in the directory ''C:\Documents\chrono\src\demos\mbs''. The directory contains all the sources needed for this example.
}}
~~~

and the code that should be put into markdown

~~~
<div class=well>
The files for this demo can be found in the directory ```C:\Documents\chrono\src\demos\mbs``` . The directory contains all the sources needed for this example.
</div>

For notes that have a symbol next to them use the following code block

<span class="label label-success"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span></span>

<span class="label label-info"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span></span>

<span class="label label-warning"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span></span>

<span class="label label-danger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></span>



~~~
<span class="label label-success"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span></span>

<span class="label label-info"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span></span>

<span class="label label-warning"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span></span>

<span class="label label-danger"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span></span>
~~~


For longer notes, that might also be multiple lines, that have a symbol next to them use the following code block:

<div class="ce-info">
This is an info
</div>

<div class="ce-warning">
This is a warning
</div>

<div class="ce-danger">
This is a danger
</div>


~~~

<div class="ce-info">
This is an info
</div>

<div class="ce-warning">
This is a warning
</div>

<div class="ce-danger">
This is a danger
</div>

~~~


### Code blocks

~~~
<source lang="py">
brick_material = chrono.ChContactMaterialNSC()
brick_material.SetFriction(0.6)
brick_material.SetDampingF(0.05)
brick_material.SetCompliance (0.00003)
brick_material.SetComplianceT(0.00001)
</source>

Becomes

*First, start SolidWorks.

*Use menu File/New... and create a new Part.

*In the Part editor, create a doric column (like those that you can find in Greek temples) by using the [[File:Tutorial_collshapes_01.jpg]] '''Revolved boss / base''' tool in the toolbar. (Just create a profile like a rectangle, where one of the vertical sides is rather an almost flat arc, and the opposite side is the axis of revolution).

*You should obtain this:
