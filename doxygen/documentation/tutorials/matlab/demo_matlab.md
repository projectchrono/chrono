Matlab engine example (demo_MTLB_matlab.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_matlab}
==========================

Entry level demo about how to use Matlab(TM) and the
[MATLAB module](group__matlab__module.html)
to plot Chrono data, 
to perform computations, etc. 

This example requires that you own a copy of Matlab(TM),
properly installed on your system (if you do not have Matlab(TM) 
installed and you try to execute demo_matlab.exe, 
it will give an error because it cannot load the 
Matlab engine dll). 

This tutorial shows how to:

- do basic interaction with Matlab (copy matrices from/to Matlab workspace)
- plot data using Matlab. 


\include demo_MTLB_matlab.cpp
