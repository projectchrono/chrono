Tracked vehicle example (demo_MBS_tracks.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_tracks}
==========================

Simulate a simplified vehicle with tracks, 
that interact with obstacles, and that can be driven by the user. 

This tutorial shows how to:

- create different 'families' of collision objects (ex. to avoid that unnecessry contacts are created between adjacent track shoes).
- make custom compound collision shapes.
- load a non-concave collision mesh that is decomposed in convex parts
