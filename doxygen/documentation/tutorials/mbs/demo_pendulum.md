Pendulum example (demo_MBS_pendulum.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_pendulum}
==========================


Create some swinging pendulums, anchored to sliding joints. 
They move when the fan pushes some air toward them. 

This tutorial shows how to:

- create a pendulum

- apply custom forces using 'force accumulators' 
 (the simplified aereodinamic drag, in this case)
 
- create constraints with upper-lower limits 
 (the horizontal sliding joints between pendula and truss)
