Rolling and spinning friction example (demo_MBS_friction.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_friction}
==========================

A benchmark that show the feature of spinning friction 
(aka 'drilling' friction) and rolling friction. 

These types of frictions are useful for rolling objects 
like wheels, spheres etc. and can be optionally turned on. 

This tutorial shows how to:

- enable rolling and spinning friction.
- impose initial velocity and angular velocity to objects.
