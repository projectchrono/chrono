Mecanum omnidirectional robot example (demo_MBS_mecanum.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_mecanum}
==========================

Simulate a small mobile robot with 
omnidirectional 'mecanum' wheels. 

Use keyboard to perform basic motion. 

This tutorial shows how to:

- make complex models, with 'barrel' collision shapes.
- add motors between parts.
- use the keyboard in Irrlicht 3D view, to interact with the system in realtime.
- manage rotations of references using ChCoordsys and ChFrame classes.
