<h3>What is {% include module.html first="PROJECT" second="CHRONO" %}?</h3>

Project Chrono is a physics-based modeling and simulation infrastructure based on a platform-independent, open-source design. The core of Project Chrono is the Chrono::Engine middleware, an object-oriented library whose C++ API can be used to develop simulation software. The other components of the Project Chrono ecosystems are: 

- Chrono::Parallel, a library for enabling parallel computation in Chrono::Engine
- Chrono::Vehicle, which provides support for vehicle dynamics simulation
- Chrono::FEA, which provides support for linear and nonlinear Finite Element Analysis
- Chrono::FSI, which provides support for fluid-solid interaction problems
- Chrono::PyEngine, which enables one to use Chrono::Engine in Python
- Chrono::SolidWorks, an add-in for the SolidWorks 3D CAD, which can be used to export 3D models and geometries from the CAD to a file to be used in Chrono::Engine

### HISTORY

The first version of the {% include module.html first="CHRONO" second="ENGINE" %} software was developed in 1998 by [Prof. Alessandro Tasora](http://dynamics.eng.unipr.it/tasora) when he was a student at the Politecnico di Milano. It was the result of a thesis in Mechanical Engineering. Originally, Chrono::Engine was meant to be a multibody simulation tool for robotics and biomechanics applications.

Until 2002, Chrono::Engine was tightly linked to the Realsoft3D modeler. In 2002-2005 the software was gradually reorganized in the form of a standalone library, just like it is today. Alessandro started working in 2005 with [Professor Mihai Anitescu](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~anitescu/) from University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratories. This joint work led to a set of advanced solvers for the case of frictional contacts. 

[Professor Dan Negrut](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~negrut/index.htm) joined the Project Chrono effort in 2007. The SBEL staff and students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been active in its development ever since. 

We took the decision to release Chrono as open source in 2013. Chrono is copyrighted by Project Chrono, a nonprofit set up in US, under a BSD 3 license. This allows for its unrestricted use. Chrono's biggest break came in 2014, when the US Army decided to invest US $1.8 million in its development as an open source platform for physics-based modeling and simulation. Chrono development is going strong with the next release planned for August 15, 2016.
