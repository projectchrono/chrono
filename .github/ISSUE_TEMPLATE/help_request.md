Please **do not** post requests for help (e.g. with installing or using Chrono) here.
Instead, you can post to the ProjectChrono Google Group forum at: https://groups.google.com/g/projectchrono

This issue tracker is for tracking Chrono development related issues only.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
