    //
    //  -2-
    //
    //   Another error is to create circular dependancies between
    //  objects with shared pointers. This would cause memory
    //  leakages.
    //   There's a workaround. For example it's ok to point from
    //  object A to object B with a shared pointer, than from B to
    //  A with a normal 'raw', weak pointer. It would be a mistake to
    //  to point 'back' from B to A with a second shared pointer
    //  becuase it would mean circular dependancy.
