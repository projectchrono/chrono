  HOW TO COMPILE THE API OF CHRONO::ENGINE

   IMPORTANT! 
   
   The Chrono::Engine API is under a major revision:
   we updated it to support the CMAKE build system.
   Therefore,  the previous document  was somewhat
   outdated - the new CMAKE-based system does not require
   any 'makefile' stuff.
   To understand how to install and compile, follow the
   new guidelines at the link

   The instructions are updated from time to time.

=== Additional info to BUILD ON A LINUX PLATFORM 


The build process in a Linux platform is similar to the
process in Windows. Here are the additional steps that you might need.


--1
Install the GNU gcc c++ compiler, if you already haven't installed
it, for example by typing in the Ubuntu shell:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential

--2 
Download and the latest Irrlicht library (ex. Irrlicht-1.7.1.zip).
It is not mandatory, but it will be used by many demos.

 --2b
Compile Irrlicht, by going in the source/ directory of Irrlicht
and by typing 'make'. After some minutes it will create the file
'libIrlicht.a' into Irrlicht source/ directory. 

 --2c
Some Irrlicht distributions have a bug: instead of copying 
'libIrlicht.a' into Irrlicht/lib/Linux/ directory, they rename
it and move in lib/ as 'Linux'. If so, re-create Irrlicht/lib/Linux/ 
by hand, and move 'libIrlicht.a' into that directory.

--3
Install the following packets (you can find them on the web) if
not already installed on your system:
. X11    / Debian (Ubuntu) : load packets "libxxf86vm1" and "libxxf86vm-dev"
. OpenGl / Debien (Ubuntu): load packets "freeglut3" and "freeglut3-dev"

--4 
Follow the instructions for building the SDK using CMake, as in Windows
(see at http://dynamics.eng.unipr.it/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page)



--NOTE


-OPTIONALLY: compile the JAVASCRIPT unit for JS scripting:
   If you want to recompile the unit for JAVASCRIPT support you must: 
  . install SpiderMonkey javascript engine. So, download packets 
     libmozjs0d [???]
     libmozjs-dev [???]
    or equivalent
  . download and unzip latest SpiderMonkey SDK, 
  . cd into js/src/  directory,
  . build the javascript SDK with "make -f Makefile.ref BUILD_OPT=1"
  . copy js/src/Linux_All_OPT.OBJ/jsautocfg.h into js/src/
  . copy js/src/Linux_All_OPT.OBJ/libjs.a  into ChronoEngine/lib/Linux32_gcc
