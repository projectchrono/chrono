/** \class ChIterativeSolverVI
\brief Base class for iterative solvers aimed at solving complementarity problems arising from QP optimization problems.

The problem is described by a variational inequality VI(Z*x-d,K):\n

<pre>
  | M -Cq'|*|q|- | f|= |0|
  | Cq -E | |l|  |-b|  |c|
</pre>
with l \f$\in\f$ Y, C \f$\in\f$ Ny, normal cone to Y\n

Also Z symmetric by flipping sign of l_i:
<pre>
  |M  Cq'|*| q|-| f|=|0|
  |Cq  E | |-l| |-b| |c|
</pre>

- case linear problem:  all Y_i = R, Ny=0, ex. all bilaterals
- case LCP: all Y_i = R+:  c>=0, l>=0, l*c=0
- case CCP: Y_i are friction cones

The default maximum number of iterations is 50.

The 'tolerance' threshold value used in the stopping criteria may have different meaning for different solvers
(threshold on maximum constraint violation, threshold on projected residual, etc). See the GetError method for an
individual iterative VI solver for details.

Diagonal preconditioning is enabled by default, but may not supported by all iterative VI solvers.
