/// classes to actually \e store their mass submatrix in memory: they just need to be able to compute with it.

/// Furthermore, the system-level mass matrix is not always formed explicitly. If a matrix-free solver is used, each
/// ChVariables (and derived) object can be asked not to \e assemble its mass submatrix, but instead to provide
/// operation related to it, Ee.g. M*x, M\\x, +=M*x, and so on. Each derived class must implement these methods.
/// Because of this, the ChVariables class does \e not include any mass submatrix by default.
