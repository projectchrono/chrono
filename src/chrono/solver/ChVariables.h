/// submatrices for a sparse representation of the problem.
///
/// See ChSystemDescriptor for more information about the overall problem and data representation.
///
/// Each ChVariables object must be able to compute a mass submatrix, that will be assembled directly inside the global
/// matrix Z, (in particular inside the block H or M). Because of this there is no need for ChVariables and derived
/// classes to actually \e store their mass submatrix in memory: they just need to be able to compute it!
///
/// Moreover, in some cases, the mass submatrix is not even needed. In fact, some Chrono solvers are matrix-free. This
/// means that each ChVariables (and derived) object can be asked not to \e assemble its mass submatrix, but instead to
/// provide operation related to it. E.g. M*x, M\\x, +=M*x, and so on... Each derived class must implement these
/// methods!

/// Because of this, the ChVariables class does \e not include any mass submatrix by default
