/// matrix, while this minimal specialization at least creates a NxN mass matrix. Of course a generic (uncompressed) NxN
/// matrix is used. This means that, for example, this class could  be used for 3D rigid bodies if N=6, however it would
/// be better to implement a more optimized class which does not create a full 6x6 matrix (since only few elements on
/// the diagonal would be different from 0 in case of rigid bodies), so use the ChVariablesBody in this case..
