/// Base class for collecting objects inherited from ChConstraint,
/// ChVariables and optionally ChKblock. These objects
/// can be used to define a sparse representation of the system.
/// This collector is important because it contains all the required
/// information that is sent to a solver (usually a VI/CCP solver, or
/// as a subcase, a linear solver).\n
/// The problem is described by a variational inequality VI(Z*x-d,K):\n
/// The matrix \f$Z\f$ that represents the problem has this form:
/// <pre>
///  | H -Cq'|*|q|- | f|= |0|
///  | Cq -E | |l|  |-b|  |c|
/// </pre>
/// with \f$Y \ni \mathbb{l}  \perp \mathbb{c} \in N_y\f$ \n
/// where \f$N_y\f$ is the normal cone to \f$Y\f$ \n
/// By flipping the sign of \f$l_i\f$, the matrix \f$Z\f$ can be symmetric (but in general non positive definite)
/// <pre>
/// | H  Cq'|*| q|-| f|=|0|
/// | Cq  E | |-l| |-b| |c|
/// </pre>
///
/// * Linear Problem: \f$ \forall i \,Y_i = \mathbb{R}, N_{y_{i}} = 0\f$ (e.g. all bilateral)
/// * Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP): \f$ 0\le c \perp l\ge0 \f$ (i.e. \f$Y_i = \mathbb{R}^+\f$)
/// * Cone Complementarity Problem (CCP): \f$Y \ni \mathbb{l}  \perp \mathbb{c} \in N_y\f$ (\f$Y_i\f$ are friction
/// cones)
///
/// *Notes*
/// 1. most often you call ConvertToMatrixForm() right after a dynamic simulation step,
///    in order to get the system matrices updated to the last timestep;
/// 2. when using Anitescu default stepper, the 'f' vector contains forces*timestep = F*dt
/// 3. when using Anitescu default stepper, 'q' represents the 'delta speed',
/// 4. when using Anitescu default stepper, 'b' represents the dt/phi stabilization term.
/// 5. usually, H = M, the mass matrix, but in some cases, ex. when using
///         implicit integrators, objects inherited from ChKblock can be added
///         too, hence H could be H=a*M+b*K+c*R (but not all solvers handle ChKblock!)
///
/// All solvers require that the description of the system
/// is passed by means of a ChSystemDescriptor object
/// that holds a list of all the constraints, variables, masses, known terms
///	(ex.forces) under the form of ChVariables, ChConstraints and ChKblock.
///
/// In this default implementation, the ChSystemDescriptor
/// simply holds a vector of pointers to ChVariables
/// or to ChConstraints, but more advanced implementations (ex. for
/// supporting parallel GPU solvers) could store constraints
/// and variables structures with other, more efficient data schemes.
