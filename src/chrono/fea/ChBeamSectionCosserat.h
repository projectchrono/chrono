/// - possibility of getting values of stresses in different points of the section
/// - possibility of using some 1D plasticity to discover plasticizing zones in the section
///
/// Limitations (TO BE REMOVED IN FUTURE using Vlasov / Prandtl theories):
/// - section torsional warping not included,
/// - torsion stresses are correct only in tube-like shapes, or similar; other models such as
///   ChElasticityCosseratAdvanced contain torsional effects via the macroscopic J constant; here there is
///   a torsion correction factor just for correcting the m_x result, but at this point, shear in material points would

/// - shear stresses (ex. cantilever with transverse load) should be almost parabolic in the section in reality,
