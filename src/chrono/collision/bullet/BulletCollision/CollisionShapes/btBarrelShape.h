///made by lathing an arc of an ellipse around the vertical Y axis.
///The center of the ellipse is on Y=0 level, and it is ofsetted by R_offset from 
///the Y axis in radial direction. The two radii of the ellipse are R_vert (for the 
///vertical direction, i.e. the axis parellel to Y) and R_hor (for the axis that
///is perpendicular to Y). Also, the solid is clamped with two discs on the top and
///the bottom, at levels Y_low and Y_high.
