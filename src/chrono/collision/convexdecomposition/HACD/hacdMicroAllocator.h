// This code snippet provides a high speed micro-allocator.
//
// The concept is that you reserve an initial bank of memory for small allocations.  Ideally a megabyte or two.
// The amount of memory reserved is equal to chunkSize*6
//
// All micro-allocations are split into 6 seperate pools.
//    They are: 0-8 bytes
//              9-32 bytes
//              33-64 bytes
//              65-128 bytes
//              129-256 bytes
//
// On creation of the micro-allocation system you preserve a certiain amount of memory for each of these banks.
//
// The user provides a heap interface to callback for additional memory as needed.
//
// In most cases allocations are order-N and frees are order-N as well.
//
// The larger a buffer you provide, the closer to 'order-N' the allocator behaves.
//
// This kind of a micro-allocator is ideal for use with STL as it does many tiny allocations.
// All allocations are 16 byte aligned (with the exception of the 8 byte allocations, which are 8 byte aligned every other one).
//
