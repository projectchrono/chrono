/// Base class for collecting objects inherited from ChLcpConstraint ,
/// ChLcpVariables and, optionally ChLcpKblock. These objects
/// can be used to define a sparse representation of the system.
///  The problem is described by a variational inequality VI(Z*x-d,K):
///
///  | M -Cq'|*|q|- | f|= |0| , l \in Y, c \in Ny, normal cone to Y
///  | Cq -E | |l|  |-b|  |c|
///
/// Also Z symmetric by flipping sign of l_i: |M  Cq'|*| q|-| f|=|0|
///                                           |Cq  E | |-l| |-b| |c|
/// * case linear problem:  all Y_i = R, Ny=0, ex. all bilaterals
/// * case LCP: all Y_i = R+:  c>=0, l>=0, l*c=0
/// * case CCP: Y_i are friction cones
/// Optionally, also objects inherited from ChLcpKblock can be added
/// too, hence M becomes M+K (but not all solvers handle ChLcpKblock!)
/// All LCP solvers require that the description of
/// the system is passed by means of a ChLcpSystemDescriptor,
/// where all constraints, variables, masses, known terms
///	(ex.forces) are represented as sparse data that
/// are objects inherited from ChLcpConstraint or ChLcpVariables.
/// Within this default implementation, the ChLcpSystemDescriptor
/// simply contains vectors with pointers to the variables
/// and constraints, but more advanced implementation (ex. for
/// supporting parallel GPU solvers) could store constraints
/// and variables structures with more efficient data schemes.
