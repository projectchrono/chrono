///  Base class for representing LCP items which introduce
/// 'variables', that is variables 'v' (and associated masses M)
/// for a sparse representation of the problem.
///
///  The problem is described by a variational inequality VI(Z*x-d,K):
///
///  | M -Cq'|*|q|- | f|= |0| , l \in Y, C \in Ny, normal cone to Y
///  | Cq -E | |l|  |-b|  |c|
///
/// Also Z symmetric by flipping sign of l_i: |M  Cq'|*| q|-| f|=|0|
///                                           |Cq  E | |-l| |-b| |c|
/// * case linear problem:  all Y_i = R, Ny=0, ex. all bilaterals
/// * case LCP: all Y_i = R+:  c>=0, l>=0, l*c=0
/// * case CCP: Y_i are friction cones
///
/// Note, all masses and variables are assembled in
/// huge matrices, but there's no need to really
/// build such matrices, in order to exploit sparsity).
///
///  Note: in sake of highest generalization, this base
/// class does NOT include a mass submatrix (a sub part of the M
/// matrix) but just declares methods such as Compute_invMb_v(),
/// (which are used by iterative solvers) which MUST
/// be implemented by child classes. This doing, some child
/// classes too may implement all three methods without needing to
/// store entire mass submatrices, if possible, in sake of efficiency.
