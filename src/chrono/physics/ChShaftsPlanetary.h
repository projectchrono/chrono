///  Planetary gears can be used to make, for instance,

///  While traditional gear reducers have one input and one
///  output, the planetary gear have two inputs and one
///  output (or, if you prefer, one input and two outputs).
///  Note that you can use this class also to make a
///  gearbox if you are interested in knowing the reaction
///  torque transmitted to the truss (whereas the basic ChLinkGear
///  cannot do this because it has only in and out); in this case
///  you just use the shaft n.1 as truss and fix it.
