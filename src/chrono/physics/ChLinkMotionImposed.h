/// A joint that enforces position and rotation between two frames on two bodies, using six 
/// rheonomic constraints. 
/// That is, position and rotation of Body 1 are precisely enforced respect to Body 1 by using 
/// functions of time, where functions are defined via ChFunctionRotation and ChFunctionPosition objects.
/// A typical usage scenario is where Body 2 is a fixed body, representing the absolute reference,
/// so you move/rotate Body 1 in space according to the provided functions; this is the case for example where
/// you have some data coming from a motion capture hardware following the motion, say, of a human head,
/// and you want to replicate the motion of that head in 3D space.
/// This joint imposes all the 6 DOFs of a body, including rotations, differently from the ChLinkTrajectory
/// that imposes only the position but leaves rotation free.
/// Note that if you are interested in simply imposing a straight motion, just use  ChLinkMotorLinearPosition,
/// and if you just need to impose a rotation on a shaft, just use the ChLinkMotorRotationAngle.
/// Note: no compliance is allowed, so if the imposed motion hits an undeformable obstacle it mets a pathological
/// situation and the solver result can be unstable/unpredictable.
/// Think at it as a 6DOF servo drive with "infinitely stiff" control.
/// By default it is initialized with no motion / no rotation, so by default is just like welding the two bodies,
/// so it is up to the user to provide proper ChFunctionRotation and a proper ChFunctionPosition.
