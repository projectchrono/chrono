# rotating body hits some hard contact, the solver might give unpredictable
# oscillatory or diverging results because of the contradiction.

# Let the motor use this motion function:

# The ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed contains a hidden state that performs the time integration
# of the angular speed setpoint: such angle is then imposed to the
# constraat the positional level too, thus avoiding angle error
# accumulation (angle drift). Optionally, such positional constraint
# level can be disabled as follows:
#
# rotmotor1.SetAvoidAngleDrift(False)

# EXAMPLE A.2
#
# - class:   ChLinkMotorRotationAngle
# - type:    rotational motor
# - control: impose a time-dependent angle=a(t)
#
# This is a simple type of rotational actuator. It assumes that
# you know the exact angular angle of the rotor respect to the stator,
# as a function of time:   angle = a(t).
# Use this to simulate servo drives in robotic systems and automation,
# where you can assume that the motor rotates with an infinitely stiff
# and reactive control, that exactly follows your prescribed motion profiles.
# Note: this is a rheonomic motor that enforces the motion
# geometrically no compliance is allowed, this means that if the

# EXAMPLE A.5
#
#
# - class:   ChLinkMotorRotationDriveline
# - type:    rotational motor
# - control: delegated to an embedded user-defined driveline/powertrain
#
# This is the most powerful motor type. It allows the creation of
# generic 1D powertrain inside this 3D motor.
# Powertrains/drivelines are defined by connecting a variable number of
# 1D objects such as ChShaft, ChClutch, ChShaftsMotor, etc. In this way, for
# example, you can represent a drive+flywheel+reducer, hence taking into account
# of the inertia of the flywheel without the complication of adding a full 3D shape that
# represents the flywheel, and withoput needing 3D constrafor gears, bearings, etc.
# The 1D driveline is "interfaced" to the two connected threedimensional
# parts using two "inner" 1D shafts, each rotating as the connected 3D part
# it is up to the user to build the driveline that connects those two shafts.
# Most often the driveline is like a graph starting at inner shaft 2 (consider
# it to be the truss for holding the motor drive, also the support for reducers
# if any) and ending at inner shaft 1 (consider it to be the output, i.e. the
# slow-rotation spindle).

# Create the motor
rotmotor5 = chrono.ChLinkMotorRotationDriveline()

# Connect the rotor and the stator and add the motor to the system:
rotmotor5.Initialize(rotor5,                # body A (slave)
                      stator5,               # body B (master)
                      chrono.ChFrameD(positionA5) ) # motor frame, in abs. coords

mphysicalSystem.Add(rotmotor5)

# You may want to change the inertia of 'inner' 1d shafts, (each has default 1kg/m^2)
# Note: they adds up to 3D inertia when 3D parts rotate about the link shaft.
# Note: do not use too small values compared to 3D inertias: it might negatively affect
# the precision of some solvers if so, rather diminish the 3D inertia of stator/rotor parts and add to these.
rotmotor5.GetInnerShaft1().SetInertia(0.2)  # [kg/m^2]
rotmotor5.GetInnerShaft2().SetInertia(0.2)  # [kg/m^2]

# Now create the driveline. We want to model a drive+reducer sytem.
# This driveline must connect "inner shafts" of s1 and s2, where:
#  s1, is the 3D "rotor5"  part A (ex. a robot arm) and
#  s2, is the 3D "stator5" part B (ex. a robot base).
# In the following scheme, the motor is [ DRIVE ], the reducer is [ REDUCER ],
# the shafts ( shown with symbol || to mean inertia) are:
#  S1: the 1D inner shaft for s1 robot arm (already present in ChLinkMotorRotationDriveline)
#  S2: the 1D inner shaft for s2 robot base (already present in ChLinkMotorRotationDriveline)
#  A : the shaft of the electric drive
#
#      S2                A                    S1
# 3d<--||---[ DRIVE ]---||-----[ REDUCER ]----||-.3d
# s2   ||                      [         ]         s1
#      ||----------------------[         ]
#

# Create 'A', a 1D shaft. This is the shaft of the electric drive, representing its inertia.

# is the equivalent of the ChLinkMotorRotationSpeed, but for 1D elements:

                     rotmotor5.GetInnerShaft2() ) # S2, the stator of the drive

mphysicalSystem.Add(my_drive)
# Create a speed(time) function, and use it in my_drive:
my_driveangle = chrono.ChFunction_Const(25 * chrono.CH_C_2PI)  # 25 [rps] = 1500 [rpm]
my_drive.SetSpeedFunction(my_driveangle)

# Create the REDUCER. We should not use the simple ChShaftsGear because
# it does not transmit torque to the support. So use ChShaftsPlanetary
# and use it in ordinary mode, keeping the carrier as truss: so it
# will connect three parts: the carrier(here the truss), the in shaft, the out shaft.

my_reducer = chrono.ChShaftsPlanetary()
my_reducer.Initialize(rotmotor5.GetInnerShaft2(),  # S2, the carrier (truss)
                       my_shaftA,                    # A , the input shaft
                       rotmotor5.GetInnerShaft1() )  # S1, the output shaft

my_reducer.SetTransmissionRatioOrdinary(1.0 / 100.0)  # ratio between wR/wA
mphysicalSystem.Add(my_reducer)

# Btw:  later, if you want, you can access / plot speeds and
# torques for whatever part of the driveline by putting lines like the following
# in the  while() {...} simulation loop:
#
# GetLog() << " 1D shaft 'A' angular speed: "      << my_shaftA.GetPos_dt() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 1D Drive angular speed: rot-stat " << my_drive.GetMotorRot_dt() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 1D Drive torque: "                 << my_drive.GetMotorTorque() << " [Ns] \n"
# GetLog() << " 3D motor angular speed: rot-stat " << rotmotor5.GetMotorRot_dt() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 3D motor torque: "                 << rotmotor5.GetMotorTorque() << " [Ns] \n"

# EXAMPLE B.3
#
# - class:   ChLinkMotorLinearForce
# - type:    linear motor
# - control: impose a time-dependent force=F(t)
#
# This actuator is moved via force as a function of time, F=F(t).
# The basic "open loop" option is to provide a F(t) at the beginning (ex using
# a feedforward model), but then there is no guarantee about the
# precise position of the slider, when the simulation runs.
# This means that, unless you update the force F at each time
# step using some type of feedback controller, this actuator
# cannot be used to follow some position setpoint. Implementing
# your controller might complicate things, but it could be closer to
# the behavior of a real actuator, that have some delay, bandwidth
# latency and compliance - for example, differently from
# other types such as ChLinkMotorLinearPosition  and
# ChLinkMotorLinearSpeed, this force motor does not enforce any
# constraon the direction of motion, so if it the slider hits
# some hard contact, it just stops and keeps pushing, and no troubles
# with the solver happen.

# limitations. A more powerful approach is to inherit from ChFunction_SetpointCallback, that automatically
# computes the derivatives, if needed, by BDF etc. Therefore:
# 1. You must inherit from the ChFunction_SetpointCallback base class, and implement the SetpointCallback()
#    function by putting the code you wish. For example something like the follow:

class MyForceClass (chrono.ChFunction_SetpointCallback) :
      def __init__(self, amp, freq, prop, der, ltime, lerr, f, motor) :
        """ THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR CORRECT INITIALIZATION: Initialize all the three in down-up order """
        chrono.ChFunction_Setpoint.__init__(self) 
        chrono.ChFunction_SetpointCallback.__init__(self) 
        
        # Here some specific data to be used in Get_y(),
        # add whatever you need, ex:
        self.setpoint_position_sine_amplitude = amp
        self.setpoint_position_sine_freq = freq
        self.controller_P = prop  # for our basic PID
        self.controller_D = der  # for our basic PID
        self.last_time = ltime
        self.last_error = lerr
        self.F = f
        self.linearmotor= motor  # may be useful later
    
        # Here we will compute F(t) by emulating a very basic PID scheme.
        # In practice, it works like a callback that is executed at each time step.
        # Implementation of this function is mandatory!!!
      def SetpointCallback(self, x) :
            # Trick: in this PID example, we need the following if(..)  to update PID
            # only when time changes (as the callback could be invoked more than once per timestep):
            time = x
            if (time > self.last_time) :
                dt = time - self.last_time
                # for example, the position to chase is this sine formula:
                setpo= self.setpoint_position_sine_amplitude * m.sin(self.setpoint_position_sine_freq * chrono.CH_C_2PI * x)
                error = setpo- self.linearmotor.GetMotorPos()
                error_dt = (error - self.last_error) / dt
                # for example, finally compute the force using the PID idea:
                self.F = self.controller_P * error + self.controller_D * error_dt
                self.last_time = time
                self.last_error = error
            
            return self.F
     # def SetSetpoint(self,y,x):
     #       chrono.ChFunction_Setpoint.SetSetpoint(self,y,x)
        
#      def Update(self, x):
#            y = self.SetpointCallback(x)
#            self.SetSetpoint(y, x)



# 2. Create the function from the custom class
mFcallback = MyForceClass(1.6,0.5,42000,1000,0,0,0,motor4)

# 3. Let the motor use our custom force:
motor4.SetForceFunction(mFcallback)

# EXAMPLE B.5
#
#
# - class:   ChLinkMotorLinearDriveline
# - type:    linear motor
# - control: delegated to an embedded user-defined driveline/powertrain
#
# This is the most powerful linear actuator type. It allows the creation of
# generic 1D powertrain inside this 3D motor.
# Powertrains/drivelines are defined by connecting a variable number of
# 1D objects such as ChShaft, ChClutch, ChShaftsMotor, etc. In this way, for
# example, you can represent a drive+flywheel+reducer+pulley system, hence taking into account
# of the inertia of the flywheel and the elasticity of the synchro belt without
# the complication of adding full 3D shapes that represents all parts.
# The 1D driveline is "interfaced" to the two connected threedimensional
# parts using two "inner" 1D shafts, each translating as the connected 3D part
# it is up to the user to build the driveline that connects those two shafts.
# Most often the driveline is like a graph starting at inner shaft 2 and ending
# at inner shaft 1.
# Note: in the part 2 there is an additional inner shaft that operates on rotation
# this is needed because, for example, maybe you want to model a driveline like a
# drive+screw you will anchor the drive to part 2 using this rotational shaft so
# reaction torques arising because of inner flywheel accelerations can be transmitted to this shaft.

positionB5 = chrono.ChVectorD(0, 0, 1)
guide5, slider5 = CreateSliderGuide(material, mphysicalSystem, positionB5)

# Create the motor
motor5 = chrono.ChLinkMotorLinearDriveline()

# Connect the rotor and the stator and add the motor to the system:
motor5.Initialize(slider5,               # body A (slave)
                   guide5,                # body B (master)
                   chrono.ChFrameD(positionB5) ) # motor frame, in abs. coords

mphysicalSystem.Add(motor5)

# You may want to change the inertia of 'inner' 1D shafts, ("translating" shafts: each has default 1kg)
# Note: they adds up to 3D inertia when 3D parts translate about the link shaft.
# Note: do not use too small values compared to 3D inertias: it might negatively affect
# the precision of some solvers if so, rather diminish the 3D inertia of guide/slider parts and add to these.
motor5.GetInnerShaft1lin().SetInertia(3.0)  # [kg]
motor5.GetInnerShaft2lin().SetInertia(3.0)  # [kg]
motor5.GetInnerShaft2rot().SetInertia(0.8)  # [kg/m^2]

# Now create the driveline. We want to model a drive+reducer sytem.
# This driveline must connect "inner shafts" of s1 and s2, where:
#  s1, is the 3D "slider5" part B (ex. a gantry robot gripper) and
#  s2, is the 3D "guide5"  part A (ex. a gantry robot base).
# In the following scheme, the motor is [ DRIVE ], the reducer is [ RACKPINION ],
# the shafts ( shown with symbol || to mean inertia) are:
#  S1: the 1D inner shaft for s1 robot arm (already present in ChLinkMotorLinearDriveline)
#  S2: the 1D inner shaft for s2 robot base (already present in ChLinkMotorLinearDriveline)
#  B : the shaft of the electric drive
# Note that s1 and s2 are translational degrees of freedom, differently
# from ChLinkMotorLinearDriveline.
#
#     S2rot              B                      S1lin
#    <--||---[ DRIVE ]---||-----[ RACKPINION ]----||-. 3d
# 3d <                          [            ]          s1
# s2 < S2lin                    [            ]
#    <--||----------------------[            ]
#

# Tell the motor that the inner shaft  'S2rot' is Z, orthogonal to
# the X direction of the guide (default was X, as for screw actuators)

motor5.SetInnerShaft2RotDirection(chrono.VECT_Z)  # in link coordinates

# Create 'B', a 1D shaft. This is the shaft of the electric drive, representing its inertia.

my_shaftB.SetInertia(0.33)  # [kg/m^2]
mphysicalSystem.Add(my_shaftB)

# Create 'DRIVE', the hispeed motor - as a simple example use a 'imposed speed' motor: this
# is the equivalent of the ChLinkMotorRotationAngle, but for 1D elements:

my_driveli = chrono.ChShaftsMotorAngle()
my_driveli.Initialize(my_shaftB,                   # B    , the rotor of the drive
                       motor5.GetInnerShaft2rot() ) # S2rot, the stator of the drive

mphysicalSystem.Add(my_driveli)

# Create a angle(time) function. It could be something as simple as

my_functsequence = chrono.ChFunction_Sequence()
my_funcsigma1 = chrono.ChFunction_Sigma(180, 0, 0.5)  # diplacement, t_start, t_end
my_funcpause1 = chrono.ChFunction_Const(0)

my_funcpause2 = chrono.ChFunction_Const(0)
my_functsequence.InsertFunct(my_funcsigma1, 0.5, 1.0, True)  # fx, duration, weight, enforce C0 continuity
my_functsequence.InsertFunct(my_funcpause1, 0.2, 1.0, True)  # fx, duration, weight, enforce C0 continuity
my_functsequence.InsertFunct(my_funcsigma2, 0.3, 1.0, True)  # fx, duration, weight, enforce C0 continuity
my_functsequence.InsertFunct(my_funcpause2, 0.2, 1.0, True)  # fx, duration, weight, enforce C0 continuity
my_functangle = chrono.ChFunction_Repeat()
my_functangle.Set_fa(my_functsequence)
my_functangle.Set_window_length(0.5 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.2)
my_driveli.SetAngleFunction(my_functangle)

# Create the RACKPINION.
# It will connect three parts:
# - S2lin, the carrier (here the truss) to transmit reaction force,
# - B,     the in (rotational) shaft,
# - S1lin, the out (translational) shaft.

my_rackpinion = chrono.ChShaftsPlanetary()
my_rackpinion.Initialize(motor5.GetInnerShaft2lin(),  # S2lin, the carrier (truss)
                          my_shaftB,                    # B,     the input shaft
                          motor5.GetInnerShaft1lin() )  # S1lin, the output shaft

my_rackpinion.SetTransmissionRatios(-1, -1.0 / 100.0, 1)
mphysicalSystem.Add(my_rackpinion)

# Btw:  later, if you want, you can access / plot speeds and
# torques for whatever part of the driveline by putting lines like the   following
# in the  while() {...} simulation loop:
#
# GetLog() << " 1D shaft 'B' angular speed: "      << my_shaftB.GetPos_dt() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 1D Drive angular speed: rot-stat " << my_driveli.GetMotorRot_dt() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 1D Drive torque: "                 << my_driveli.GetMotorTorque() << " [Ns] \n"
# GetLog() << " 3D actuator speed: rot-stat " << motor5.GetMotorPos() << " [rad/s] \n"
# GetLog() << " 3D actuator force: "                 << motor5.GetMotorForce() << " [Ns] \n"
# etc.

# EXAMPLE B.6
#
# - class:   ChLinkMotorLinearPosition
# - type:    linear motor
# - control: impose a position by continuously changing it during the while{} simulation
#
# We use again the  ChLinkMotorLinearPosition as in EXAMPLE B.1, but
# this time we change its position using a "brute force" approach, that is:
# we put a line in the while{...} simulation loop that continuously changes the
# position by setting a value from some computation.
#  Well: here one might be tempted to do  motor6.SetMotionFunction(myconst) where
# myconst is a ChFunction_Const object where you would continuously change the value
# of the constant by doing  myconst.Set_yconst() in the while{...} loop this would
# work somehow but it would miss the derivative of the function, something that is used
# in the guts of ChLinkMotorLinearPosition. To overcome this, we'll use a  ChFunction_Setpoint
# function, that is able to guess the derivative of the changing setpoby doing numerical
# differentiation each time you call  myfunction.SetSetpoint().
#  Note: A more elegant solution would be to inherit our custom motion function
# from  ChFunction_SetpointCallback  as explained in EXAMPLE B.4, and then setting
# motor6.SetMotionFunction(mycallback) this would avoid polluting the while{...} loop
# but sometimes is faster to do the quick & dirty approach of this example.
