Tracked Vehicle modeling library
Author: Justin Madsen, 2014
========

Vehicle models created using a subsystem based heirarchy approach.
Demo models include a M113 Armored Personnel carrier, built with realistic model parameters.
User can add new subsystems by creating the source .h/.cpp files and adding them to the CMakeLists for ChronoEngine_unit_TrackVehicle_SOURCES and ChronoEngine_unit_TrackVehicle_HEADERS.
