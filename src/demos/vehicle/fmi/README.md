Chrono::Vehicle FMI demos
=========================

### Demos using co-simulation FMUs

- demo_VEH_FMI2_WheeledVehiclePtrain_a
  FMI 2.0 co-simulation of a vehicle+powertrain FMU with external (Chrono) subsystems for tires, driver, and terrain.
  (1 FMU + 6 Chrono subsystems)

- demo_VEH_FMI2_WheeledVehicle_a
  FMI 2.0 co-simulation of a vehicle FMU with external (Chrono) subsystems for powertrain, tires, driver, and terrain.
  (1 FMU + 7 Chrono subsystems)

- demo_VEH_FMI2_WheeledVehiclePtrain_b
  FMI 2.0 co-simulation of a vehicle+powertrain FMU with FMUs for tires and driver and external terrain.
  (6 FMUs + 1 Chrono subsystem)

- demo_VEH_FMI2_WheeledVehicle_b
  FMI 2.0 co-simulation of a vehicle FMU with FMUs for powertrain, tires, and driver and external terrain.
  (7 FMUs + 1 Chrono subsystem)
  
### Demos using model exchange FMUs

- demo_VEH_FMI2_PathFollower
  Simulation of a wheeled vehicle double-lane change using a vehicle driver implemented as a model exchange FMU.
