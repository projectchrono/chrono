// Base class for a steerable leaf-spring solid axle suspension.
// Derived from ChSuspension, but still an abstract base class.
//
// This implementation follows the SAE Spring Design Handbook, which shows the use
// of a kinematic leafspring model made of three links. The three 'links' are
// front leaf / clamp / rear leaf / shackle. The clamp is considered as rigid
// and part of the axle tube in the SAE book. In this chrono model we had to
// split the clamp into two separate bodies clampA and clampB. Both are connected
// via a rotational joint around Z. This was necessary because we need to mimic
// the lateral compliance of the leafspring. The leaves (front and rear) are connected
// to clampA rsp. clampB via rotational joints around Y. The frontleaf also connects
// to the chassis with a spherical joint, while the rearleaf connects to the shackle
// body with a sperical joint. The shackle body connects to the chassis via a
// rotational joint around Y.
//
// The vertical stiffnesses are simulated by the rotational springs of the frontleaf
// and the rearleaf while the lateral stiffnesses are simulated by the rotational
// joints of the clamp bodies.
//
// For the stiffness parameters the user can take the desired translatoric vertical
// stiffness devided by two (we have two leaves). The preload can be set as a
// vertical force devided by two. The conversion to the rotary setup is made
// automatically.
//
// The SAE model allows to consider the correct axle movement due to wheel travel.
// It is possible to consider the tie-up mode due to longitudinal forces (breaking).
// It also possible to use different stiffnesses for the front leaf and the rear
// leaf, many practical designs use this to avoid tie-up problems.
//
// This axle subsystem works with the ChRotaryArm steering subsystem.
//
// The suspension subsystem is modeled with respect to a right-handed frame,
// with X pointing towards the front, Y to the left, and Z up (ISO standard).
// The suspension reference frame is assumed to be always aligned with that of
// the vehicle.  When attached to a chassis, only an offset is provided.
